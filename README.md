[WIP] Lightweight hardcore/realistic Minecraft modpack for Forge 1.10.2
Heavily inspired by FTB Infinity Evolved, Age of Engineering and Homestead

This is my attempt to create a realistic modpack (or hardcore, as you put it) for lightweight PCs. Created originally as a project on an Apple Mac Air to replace FTB Infinity Envolved Expert Mode in 1.7.10 by a smaller, better performing 1.10.2 modpack, evolved to the plan of an equally involving modpack experience with basic content mods (both magic and tech), addons for said mods, small complicating survival mods, helpful/relatively unknown mods, difficult recipes and progression lines in magic and tech.

Aim(s):
  -the beginning is meant to be as 'Vanilla' as possible ('Vanilla' in a property way), so the player can't use basic magic,
   teleportation, even energy production won't be unlocked until they defeat the Ender Dragon.
  -there will be no mod that changes worldgen (to create a map preview in an online app like Mineatlas or Chunkbase)
  -every implemented era can be play on its own






The plan for this modpack is
  1. keeping a low number of mods included (currently: about 105 mods) (progression: 95%)
  
  2. inweaving the mods in a semi-realistic/reasonable way, to create dependencies among all mods. 
  This will included
  
    2.1 establishing a era system. Every era will be dedicated to a certain theme which can work at its own as a whole 
    modpack, beginning with a Vanilla-Plus-like to the final AE2/Extreme Reactors collection. (script progression: 45%)
    
    2.2 changing disabled items to use them as new crafting materials (only idea, progression: 0%)
    
    2.3 adding the recipes/functionality via Crafttweaker and config changes (progression: 15% (pessimistic))
  
  3. (optional) adding a quest book and enriching the quest with lore (especially for magic mods) (progression: -%)
