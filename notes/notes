mods to integrate:

astral sorcery
tech reborn
ars magicka

lithium batteries depending on manganese dust and carbon plates
may be used for
	Psi batteries
	fusion reactor
	OpenComputers capacitor?
	AE2 energy cells
	portable generator (Immersive Engineering)
	energycell cell frame
	upgrade kits

magnesium in lamps and floodlights
fireworks, fireresistent bricks (tinkers), 
fertilizer (floral)


nitrogen for cooling processes like
vacuum frezzer
cooling coils
coolant cells
cooler
upgrade kits 
fridge
Psi batteries
endgame electronics

chlorite for leather processed from rotten flesh

chlorite and sodium for industrial salt production??
(distiller spits salt out already, so maybe not)

sulfuric acid as the base of capacitors from immersive engineering
and power cells 
(will have to balance, chemical reactor should be available later, 
and sulfur cell has no recipe!!!) (sulfur dust with distilled
water)

lead in fridges 

psidust and silicon in an insciber to
printed silicon

maybe adjust ALL TechReborn machines (chemical reactor earlier,
circuits more expensive, industrial electrolyzer later)

electrical steel is depending on silicon which has been nerfed
possible: electrical steel from sand/quartz and steel in TechReborn
blast furnace
equally difficult, but more realistic???


ars magicka raw essence won't be generated in world
suggestion: throwing liquid starlight bucket in manapool
