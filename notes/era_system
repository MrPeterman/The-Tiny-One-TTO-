Eras 

The era system was created intending to group up the states of the game. It is NOT a progression
tree, it's not meant to force the player to progress. The player is able to just stay in every
era they advanced to and concentrate on different aspects of the game (building, exploration, automaition, farm builiding)




	0 vanilla/origin
mods:
Vanilla, Quark, Hopperducts, Forestry Backpacks, Thermal Gear, Water Strainers, Redstone Paste
Bird's Nests, Harvestcraft, Chisel, Chisels & Bits, Animania, Storage Drawers, Backport

Progression:
This era resembles a collection of mods you would normally find in an hard "VanillaPlus" Pack.
My main aim was to create a environment where your basic vanilla experience/immersion isn't 
destroyed/interrupted by overpowered items as well as where the enabled mods add features fitting 
well in Vanilla Minecraft.
